# pathology API

## Testing

The pathology API has four types of tests, each serving a different purpose:

- **[Unit, Contract, & Schema Tests](tests/README.md)** - Developer-focused technical tests using pytest
- **[BDD Acceptance Tests](features/README.md)** - Business-focused assurance tests using behave

### Continuous Integration

All four test types (unit, contract, schema, and integration) run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline on every push and pull request. **Any test failure at any level will cause the pipeline to fail and prevent the PR from being merged.**

Additionally, code coverage is collected from all test types, merged, and analyzed by SonarCloud. PRs must meet minimum coverage thresholds to pass quality gates.

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run all unit, contract, and schema tests
poetry run pytest -v

# Run all BDD acceptance tests
poetry run behave

# Run specific test suites
poetry run pytest tests/unit/            # Unit tests only
poetry run pytest tests/contract/        # Contract tests only
poetry run pytest tests/schema/          # Schema validation tests only
poetry run behave features/hello_world.feature  # Specific feature
```

For detailed testing documentation, see the README files in each test directory.
