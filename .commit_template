[CDAPI-]:


# Instructions for GitHub Copilot:
# - Always start the commit summary with a JIRA key in the form '[CDAPI-<ticket-number>]:'.
# You can usually derive the ticket-number from the branch name, but if unclear then don't guess.
# - Use a short, imperative summary line after the JIRA key.
# - Leave a blank line, then list bullet points describing the main changes.
# - Do not mention files, diffs, or test commands explicitly unless requested.
#
# Example:
# CDAPI-123: Add validation for patient IDs
#
# - Validate NHS number format on request
# - Return 400 for invalid IDs
# - Add unit tests for edge cases
